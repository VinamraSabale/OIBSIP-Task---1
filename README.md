# OIBSIP-Task---1

Task1: Iris Flower Classification.
In this project, I built a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The model was trained on the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each sample.

The Logistic model achieved high accuracy in classifying the flowers, and I evaluated its performance using various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The project demonstrates how SVM can be utilized for multi-class classification tasks and serves as an example of applying machine learning in real-world scenarios.
